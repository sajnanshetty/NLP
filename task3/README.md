## Goal
* Understand the concepts First Class Functions Map Filter Zip Reduce partial functions

## Objective
```
1. Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not.
 You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000 PTS:100
2. Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write an expression that
    1. add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
    2. strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
    3. acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
    4. acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
    5. takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
3. A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph, and checks whether it has any of the swear
 words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt PTS:200 (Links to an external site.)
4. Using reduce function: PTS:100
    1. add only even numbers in a list
    2. find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
    3. adds every 3rd number in a list
5. Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates,
 where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999 PTS:100
6. Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided. Now use a partial
 function such that 1000/9999 are hardcoded, but KA can be provided
